Overview
Models: Represent the data structure of your application and map to database tables.

ViewModels: Tailored data structures specifically for views (UI), often combining multiple models or adding properties needed for presentation.

Repositories: Abstract the data access layer, providing a clean interface for your application to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database.
